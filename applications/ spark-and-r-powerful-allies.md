## Introduction  

Since Apache Spark version 1.5, [SparkR](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sparkr.html) allows the fitting of generalized linear models over DataFrames using the [glm()](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/R/glm.html) function. This is a great oportunity to incorporate Spark into our Exploratory Data Analysis pipeline using R and the R ecosystem, including libraries such as [ggplot2](). We are really excited about it, so in this analysis we are going to have a look at the [2013 American Community Survey dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/2013-american-community-survey) using R and SparkR dataframes and machine learning capabilities.  

## The 2013 American Community Survey dataset    

Every year, the US Census Bureau runs the American Community Survey. In this survey, approximately 3.5 million households are asked detailed questions about who they are and how they live. Many topics are covered, including ancestry, education, work, transportation, internet use, and residency. Although this data is public, we will us the file published on Kaggle.
